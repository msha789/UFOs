## Summary 

### Drawback 
- It can be difficult for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to filtera city, the user has to go through the table and find the city they want for the analysis. 

### Recommendations 
- A way to address the above drawback would be to present drop-down lists which would include all values to choose from in place of the input fields. 
- Additionally, including a button to clear the filters would also be helpful. The button could be located below the last filter.
