## Summary 

### Drawback 
- One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis. 

### Recommendations 
- A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
- Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button could be located below the last filter.
